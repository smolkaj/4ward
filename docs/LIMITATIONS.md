# 4ward — Known Limitations

> Living document. Add entries when you take a shortcut or discover a gap.
> Remove entries when they get resolved.

Intentional shortcuts, missing features, and known gaps in the current
implementation. This is the place to record trade-offs so they don't get
lost in commit messages or forgotten entirely.

Agents: when you take a shortcut or skip a corner case, add it here. No
guilt — just write it down so someone can find it later.

## Architecture support

- **PSA: 74 corpus STF tests pass + 73 compile-only tests.** The PSA
  two-pipeline architecture (ingress + egress) is implemented with support for
  `send_to_port`, `ingress_drop`, `egress_drop`, `multicast`, I2E/E2E cloning
  (via `ostd.clone` + `clone_session_id`), recirculate (`PSA_PORT_RECIRCULATE`),
  resubmit (`ostd.resubmit`), registers, `Hash.get_hash` (headers, structs,
  bare fields, 1-arg and 3-arg forms), `Meter.execute` (stub GREEN),
  `Random.read()`, `InternetChecksum` (clear/add/subtract/get/get_state/set_state),
  `Digest.pack` (stub no-op), counters (indirect + direct), action profiles,
  action selectors (including fork-based trace trees for group hits), parser
  `value_set`, header stacks, and top-level assignments. 73 additional PSA
  programs (BMv2 + DPDK targets) are verified to compile. PNA and TNA are not
  implemented.

## Externs

- **No user-defined extern functions.** Extern functions declared in P4
  without a body (e.g. `extern void f(out bit<32> d, bit<32> s)`) cannot be
  executed — their semantics exist only in architecture-specific libraries.
  Blocks 1 corpus test (`extern-funcs-bmv2`).
- **Meters always return GREEN.** `meter.execute_meter()` and
  `direct_meter.read()` always return GREEN (0). Rate limiting is not
  simulated — there are no real packet rates in STF tests.
- **`digest` is a no-op stub.** PSA `Digest.pack()` is accepted but doesn't
  deliver messages to the control plane. v1model `digest()` is not implemented.

## P4Runtime server

- **Full multi-controller arbitration with role-based access control.**
  Per-role primary election, demotion/promotion notifications, automatic
  promotion on disconnect, and `@p4runtime_role` enforcement for reads and
  writes (P4Runtime spec §5, §15). `Role.config` (target-specific policy)
  is rejected with UNIMPLEMENTED.
- **`@p4runtime_translation`: fully integrated for action params, match fields,
  and PacketIO metadata.** The `TypeTranslator` supports `sdn_bitwidth` and
  `sdn_string` with explicit, auto-allocate, and hybrid mapping modes.
  `PacketHeaderCodec` handles `packet_in`/`packet_out` header serialization
  per p4info `controller_packet_metadata`, tested E2E on SAI P4.
- **Direct meters always return GREEN.** Direct meter configs can be
  written and read via P4Runtime, but the simulator does not perform
  real rate limiting — `direct_meter.read()` always returns the default
  color (GREEN).
- **No digests or idle timeouts (by design).** Both are inherently
  time-dependent features that have no meaningful semantics in a reference
  simulator: there are no real packet rates to trigger digests, and no
  wall-clock time to expire idle entries. These are explicitly out of scope.

## DVaaS validation service

- **All three injection modes supported.** `INPUT_TYPE_DATAPLANE`,
  `INPUT_TYPE_PACKET_OUT`, and `INPUT_TYPE_SUBMIT_TO_INGRESS` are fully
  implemented. `PACKET_OUT` requires a pipeline with `@controller_header`;
  `SUBMIT_TO_INGRESS` requires a configured CPU port.
- **PacketIn metadata populated.** Outputs on the CPU port are classified as
  `PacketIn` with metadata fields (e.g. `ingress_port`) derived from p4info.
- **GenerateTestVectors as reference model.** The `GenerateTestVectors` RPC
  implements the core of sonic-pins' `DataplaneValidationBackend` — computing
  expected outputs by simulating packets through the loaded pipeline. This
  replaces BMv2 as the reference model. Upstream integration requires a thin
  C++ wrapper implementing `DataplaneValidationBackend` that calls this gRPC
  service.
- **No packet synthesis (SynthesizePackets).** The backend does not generate
  interesting test packets automatically. Upstream DVaaS uses p4_symbolic
  (Z3-based symbolic execution) for this; callers must provide input packets.
- **Non-numeric port strings not supported.** SAI P4 programs using
  `@p4runtime_translation` with string port identifiers (e.g. "Ethernet0")
  require type translation that isn't wired into the DVaaS service yet.
  Port strings must be parseable as integers.

## Simulator

- **Multicast: basic replication only.** Multicast group replication works
  for the trace tree (forking per replica). PRE entries are installed via
  P4Runtime `PacketReplicationEngineEntry`.

## Web playground

- **Single-replica clone sessions.** The UI creates clone sessions with one
  replica. Multi-replica cloning requires the gRPC API.
- **No multicast group UI.** The backend supports multicast groups, but the
  web UI only exposes clone sessions.
- **No MODIFY for table entries.** The UI only supports INSERT and DELETE.
  To change an entry, delete and re-add it.
- **No default action changes.** There is no UI to change a table's default
  action.
- **RANGE match type not supported.** The match field input falls through to
  exact-match encoding — range values will be silently misinterpreted.
- **No counters, meters, registers, or action profile UI.** These P4Runtime
  entities are supported by the backend but not exposed in the browser.
- **Read API only returns table entries.** `GET /api/read` hard-codes a
  `TableEntry` filter. Clone sessions, counters, and other entity types
  cannot be read back through the REST API.
- **Forking programs: output packets panel shows "dropped".** When the trace
  tree forks (clone, multicast), output packets appear only in branch leaves
  of the trace — the top-level `output_packets` list is empty. The user must
  inspect the Trace tab.
- **No `StreamChannel`.** The web UI uses REST APIs, not the P4Runtime
  bidirectional stream. This means no PacketIO (`packet_in`/`packet_out`),
  no digest notifications, and no arbitration updates. Packets are injected
  directly to the simulator; controller-bound packets are silently lost.
- **No packet history.** Only the most recent packet result is shown. Sending
  another packet overwrites the previous output.
- **No persistence.** Pipeline and table state are in-memory. Restarting the
  server clears everything. Editor content is not saved across page refreshes.
- **Single shared state.** All browser sessions share one simulator instance.
  Concurrent users will interfere with each other.
- **No compilation timeout.** The p4c subprocess has no timeout. A
  pathological P4 program could hang the server indefinitely.
- **Monaco editor requires internet.** Loaded from `cdn.jsdelivr.net`.
  The playground does not work offline.
- **Three bundled examples only.** `basic_table`, `passthrough`, `mirror`.

## BMv2 differential testing

- **System libgmp/libpcap dependency.** The BMv2 build links against system
  `libgmp` and `libpcap` rather than building them from source. The build uses
  genrules to copy headers into the build tree, but runtime linking requires the
  libraries to be installed (e.g. via Homebrew on macOS).
- **All 186 corpus tests pass.**

## p4c backend

- **`gauntlet_various_ops-bmv2` compilation timeout.** p4c-4ward takes 10+
  minutes on this program. Performance issue, not a missing feature. Blocks
  1 corpus test.
- **`psa-subtract-inst1` OOM during compilation.** p4c-4ward is killed by the
  OS during compilation. Same class of issue as `gauntlet_various_ops-bmv2`.
