/**
 * Interface for architecture-specific pipeline behaviour.
 *
 * Different P4 architectures (v1model, PSA, PNA) share the same IR interpreter but differ in:
 * 1. Pipeline structure: which parsers and controls run and in what order.
 * 2. Standard metadata: the metadata struct passed between stages.
 * 3. Extern semantics: what clone(), resubmit(), recirculate() etc. actually do.
 *
 * Points 1 and 2 are driven by the [fourward.ir.Architecture] proto in the loaded pipeline config.
 * Point 3 requires code here.
 *
 * To add a new architecture, implement this interface and register the implementation in
 * [Simulator].
